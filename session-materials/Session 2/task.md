1. Create an array of objects representing users (e.g., `name`, `age`, `gender`).
2. Use best applicant of `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to perform operations on this array.
    - Get new array of males only and one for females.
    - Category users based on age and add it as new entity called `ageGroup`.
        - ageGroups are `adult`, `teen`, `kid`
3. For the following code: 
    ```javascript
        const products = [
      { name: "Laptop", price: 1200, category: "Electronics" },
      { name: "Shirt", price: 50, category: "Clothing" },
      { name: "Phone", price: 800, category: "Electronics" },
      { name: "Jeans", price: 40, category: "Clothing" },
      { name: "TV", price: 500, category: "Electronics" },
      { name: "Shoes", price: 70, category: "Clothing" }
    ];
    ```
    - get only "Electronics" products.
    - extract the names of those "Electronics" products.
    - join those names into a single string separated by commas.

 

3. Search about 
    - promises 
    - Asynchronous & synchronous
