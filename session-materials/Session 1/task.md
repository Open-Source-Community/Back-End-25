### 1. Print all even numbers from 0 – 10
Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.

### 2. Print a table containing multiplication tables
Let’s start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication tables from 1 through 10?

Like Challenge #1, can you create an efficient solution that you could easily expand should you need the 12 times table?

### 3. Create a length converter function
Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.


### 4. Remove the spaces found in a string
Yet another way to clean up data is to remove any errors or unnecessary spaces. This function will take in a string and then return it with all spaces removed. Think about if you were tasked with cleaning up customer data at your job. You could scale this function to clean up specific fields of data, such as zip codes.

### 5. Return a Boolean if a number is divisible by 10
Here, you’ll create a function that’ll give you a “true” or “false” Boolean as its output. The inputted number should only return a “true” if it’s divisible by 10. Otherwise, your program should return a “false” answer.

### 6. Return the number of vowels in a string 
Create a function that’ll return an integer of the number of vowels found in a string. This is a great way to practice determining the features of a dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you’ll be well-prepared to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. If you feel like an extra challenge, consider returning the number of characters.

### 7. Create a function that finds the maximum number in an array [Bonus]
In this challenge, you’ll write a function that takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the largest number in that array. Test your function with various arrays, including arrays with negative numbers, decimals, and all positive integers.

### 8. Create a function that takes (name, email, password) and return object contain this entities  [Bonus]

### 9. Check if a string is a palindrome [Bonus]
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (like the words “kayak,” “mom,” “radar,” and “refer”). Create a function that takes a string as input and returns a Boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome. Test your function with different strings to ensure it works correctly.
